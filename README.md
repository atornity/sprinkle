# âœ¨ sprinkle âœ¨
ðŸš§ WIP ðŸš§

if you want to test this you'll need [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

once you installed rustup you can clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/atornity/sprinkle.git` and run it with `cargo run`.  
you might also need to run `rustup toolchain install nightly-2023-05-05`. (I haven't checked :3)

you'll see there's no ui at all. currently the key bindings are:
- [b] : brush
- [g] : bucket
- [left mouse] : use brush/bucket with main color
- [right mouse] : use brush/bucket with secondary color
- [,] : undo
- [.] : redo

there's not saving or loading or anything (yet)
